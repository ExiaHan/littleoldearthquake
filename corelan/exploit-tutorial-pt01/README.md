This is basically following along with this tutorial:

https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/

Only writing the exploits using Python.

Tools / Things You Need:
* A Windows XP / SP3 VM
* Metasploit (Community Edition, 4.9.3 from: http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/download.jsp)
* -OR- Kali Linux (http://www.kali.org/downloads/)
* Windbg -OR- Immunity Debugger (I'm using Windbg)

Other tools / vulnerable app downloads are available in the folders in this repo.

In Kali Linux:

/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/
./pattern-create.rb 5000

Made the app crash and got EIP set to 0x42376a42

/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/
./pattern_offset.rb 0x42376a42 5000
Exact match at offset 1071


The final shellcode came from https://code.google.com/p/win-exec-calc-shellcode/downloads/detail?name=win-exec-calc-shellcode-302.zip

The actual exploit m3u file is launch_calc_win-exec-calc-shellcode.m3u
